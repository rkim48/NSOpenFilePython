## Ripple Neuroshare Python Port
### Description
This project is a Python port of the original MATLAB code for opening and processing Ripple Neuroshare files (NEV, NSX). The original MATLAB function ns_OpenFile.m is included as a reference. Not all features from the original code have been translated to Python, but the essential functionality is present. A test script with a sample.nev file is included for demonstration purposes.
